Thx mgmnt.\" Does that mean the speaker system or computer system?  Pulled to window and no one was inside to explain what was going on either. Saturday night we pulled up and someone came over the speaker to say the computers were down and would be for at least another 45 mins. Tonight, Sunday,  I pulled up at 11:15 to a car pulling out (guessing an employee) and all lights off...online says they're open until midnight and the sign between the two drive thru windows said Open 24 hours.

They still had the dinner menu up and when I told them over the speaker, I was asked \"We can come out and change it, if you want?\". How am I going to order breakfast without an menu and do I want to wait who know's how long for you to change it? This place always sucks every single time I come here. It's either, we sold out of everything or that's not available or no one answers the drive-thru and you have to wait......  There is always some BS here and will NEVER be coming back..",

In the middle of my explaining the situation, she tells me to hold, puts the phone down, I'm holding for about 4 minutes, then she hangs the phone up. I tried calling back. She refuses to answe the phone. Then I called corporate office. I bet she wishes she would've remained on the phone and ptofessionally handled this customer complaint. With all due respect, I don't really think she understood what I was saying as she had a heavy Spanish accent, and barely responded to what I was saying. And I'm Hispanic so this is in no way attacking her race, or ethnicity. ",
